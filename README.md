# Real Time Car Counter Live Demo

## About
The car counter demo will identify and count cars from an overhead perspective using a YOLOv8 Model.  For information about YOLO, please [visit the YOLOv8 docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/).

## System Requirements
### Demo Requirements
* An operating system such as Windows, Mac, or Linux that has access to a terminal (NOTE: the commands shown here are for Windows, but should be applicable to Mac and Linux as well)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
    * To ensure that you have git installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type `git --version`
    <pre><code>
    C:\some\dir>git --version
    git version 2.42.0.windows.2
    </code></pre> 
* A browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
* A current release of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed. (NOTE: [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) will work as well, but you may have to translate some of the following steps using the [conda docs](https://docs.anaconda.com/).  If you're unsure, just use python)
    * To check that you've got python installed, open a terminal and type in `python --version`.  You're output should look something like this:
    <pre><code>
    C:\some\dir>python --version
    Python 3.11.8
    </code></pre>
    Note that the directory given here is only for example purposes.
    * Next, check that pip is installed by typing `python -m pip --version`.  
    <pre><code>
    C:\some\dir>python -m pip --version
    pip 24.0 from C:\install\dir\Python311\site-packages\pip (python 3.11)
